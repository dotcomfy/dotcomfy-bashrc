# Handy stuff for Linux on the desktop
I could not think of where to put these notes, so they can live here for now.

## Gnome: Classic move/resize behaviour using mouse buttons and keyboard modifier
Move with left mouse button, resize with right
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/28514/how-to-get-altright-mouse-to-resize-windows-again

Enable right button resize:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences resize-with-right-button true
```

By default, gnome uses Super (Windows key), but that can be changed.
I have tried using control, which works better with the mouse on the left, but then ctrl-click stops working in web browsers.
Slightly better seems to be to remap the Windows menu key to be another Windows key (Super) and leave the setting on default.

Tweaks -> Keyboard & Mouse -> Additional Layout Options -> Alt/Win key behaviour -> Menu is mapped to Win

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier '<Alt>'
```

## Keyboard shortcuts in Gnome not working other than in default keyboard layout, in Wayland
This may have been fixed now.
```
ibus exit
```

## Other keyboard settings
Use gnome-tweak-tool

Under Additional Layout Options, you can disable caps lock

This also contains lots of other keyboard options

## Make things like visudo use the right editor (they ignore $EDITOR and use nano instead)
```
sudo update-alternatives --config editor
```

## Enable hibernate/suspend to disk

Unless you install uswsusp, then hibernate just shuts down
```
sudo apt install uswsusp
```

If swap has changed, then a new initrd needs to be generated:
```
sudo update-initramfs  -k '5.4.0-29-generic' -v -u
```

You also need to set the resume parameter for the kernel, which in turn sets /sys/power/resume

To enable it right away:
Use `lsblk` to find the swap device minor:major, then: `echo 259:7 > /sys/power/resume`

For kernel param, find the UUID using `blkid`
Set in /etc/default/grub, then run update-grub
Example:
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text resume=UUID=b0e3fbc0-309f-41f9-871e-513eef6a2f30"

```

## USB Wake
Note that you may need to enable wakeup not only for the actual device, but also the parents

If device IDs are not static, but you know which devices to look for:
```
for dev in $(grep .  /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/product | grep -E "Mouse|Keyboard|Hub" | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sed 's/.product$//') ; do
  echo "Enabling USB wake for device: $dev"
  echo enabled > $dev/power/wakeup
done
```

This may work if the devices are static:
```
grep .  /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/product
grep . /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup
# Find the right devices, then:
echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-3.3.4/power/wakeup
echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-3.3/power/wakeup
echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-3/power/wakeup
```

If this all works, then put the commands into /etc/rc.local or similar

## L2TP VPN
Install the required software, and then you can set it up in Settings
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install network-manager-l2tp
sudo apt-get install network-manager-l2tp-gnome
```


## Microsoft OneDrive
There are multiple options for OneDrive sync

Rclone
Sort of like rsync for cloud storage. Does not do two-way sync, but there are third party tools for this. Useful for backups?

https://www.insynchq.com/ - allegedly works with OneDrive and Team Sites

ExpanDrive

I know that when setting up GNOME. you get asked if you want to log into OneDrive and other online services, but I never used it myself. I have Nextcloud on a v-server and that is all I need.
